# gtool 
*tiny little rust-powered git helper tool because why not?*

## what does it do?

**gtool** makes git commands shorter and lazier, because typing  
```
git add .
git commit -m "something"
git push origin main
```
is very boring, so i made this.

## features

### quick commits

Automatically:
- adds files
- commits
- and pushes!
(with options like `--no-push`, `--amend`, `--files`, etc.)

### status command

shows a readable status of your git, not much more.
